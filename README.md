# MLME Anton Buus Hansen
This is the repository containing code for the MLME-miniproject hand-in. It uses the med701 semester project as a foil for some of the VR functionality
The scene is better played with a VR headset but can be tested by simply dragging the XR-setup in the scene to move the player.


To find the relevant scene: In the project go to Assets\_Anton\InteractML and open the scene named "MLME_AntonBuusHansen"
